  How many hits does Ichiro Suzuki have? It seems like a simple question, but the answer, like everything in Suzuki’s world, is not simple. <img src="tttt.jpg" width="20%">

Some numbers are clear. After starting this season 0 for 5, Suzuki announced his retirement on Thursday, leaving him with 3,089 hits across parts of 19 major league seasons. In Japan, where he began his career, he had 1,278 hits in nine seasons.

Those totals have him ranked 23rd in the majors — <p style="margin-top:55px;">

  21 hits behind Dave Winfield and seven ahead of Albert Pujols — and 95th in Japan. But it has become common to simply combine the totals, crediting him with 4,367 career hits, thus pushing him past Pete Rose as baseball’s hit king </p>
